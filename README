Sorry, Rich, luck is with me again.  About 2 weeks ago, someone here
brought me a very odd tape, and it exposed several problems with copytape
(v10 i90).  I corrected the source, but I forget that I had sent it to
you.

Here's a corrected copytape.  I thought of making a diff, but that was
13k, and the whole shar was only 14k!
